# iOS Photo App Challenge
Coding Challenge: A mobile app that captures, stores and displays photos

## Build Instructions


## Approach
I started working on this take home test by separating the task description into small issues. These issues filled up a simple [Kanban board](https://github.com/easytargetmixel/ios-photo-app-challenge/projects/1), along with my initial thoughts and ideas in the issue descriptions. 

## Possible Improvements

During the initial project phase and as I made progress, I identified several additional features and potential improvements. Whenever I have an idea during the development process, I try to turn it into a full-fledged issue. Not only does this ensure that ideas do not get lost, it also acts as a kind of filter. Adding a short issue description and prioritising an issue helps determining the feasibility of a feature. Additional features and potential changes can be found in the [Issues Section](https://github.com/easytargetmixel/ios-photo-app-challenge/issues).
